Brain Cancer Gene Expression - CuMiDa GSE50161 Microarray Dataset
This repository contains the analysis of the Brain Cancer Gene Expression dataset (GSE50161), sourced from the CuMiDa (Curated Microarray Database). The dataset originates from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and focuses on identifying critical gene expression patterns related to brain cancer.

Dataset Overview

The dataset includes microarray data capturing the expression levels of thousands of genes across samples representing brain cancer subtypes and healthy controls. The primary objective is to study these gene expression profiles to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying brain cancer and to differentiate between healthy and diseased states.

Key Features

* High-Dimensional Gene Expression Data: Each sample contains expression measurements for thousands of genes.
* Sample Labels: The dataset is labeled, indicating whether each sample belongs to a specific brain cancer subtype or represents a control (healthy tissue).
* Research Focus: This dataset is widely used for gene expression analysis, cancer subtype classification, and visualization.

Project Objective

In this project, the t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) algorithm is applied to reduce the high-dimensional gene expression data into a 2D space. The goal is to visualize and explore the clustering patterns that distinguish different brain cancer subtypes and healthy samples, providing an intuitive understanding of the dataâ€™s structure.

Applications

This dataset is suitable for tasks involving:

* Gene expression analysis
* Dimensionality reduction and visualization (e.g., t-SNE, PCA)
* Classification of cancer subtypes
* Exploratory data analysis in biological research
